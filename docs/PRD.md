| -------- | -------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FM-01-01 | List with pagination | ✅ Done | URL-synced `?page=N`, skeleton loading, refetch overlay          |

**User Flow:**

1. Admin navigates to Backoffice Members via sidebar accordion
2. Table loads with paginated data, URL reflects current page
3. Click "Add New" → create form with validation errors from API
4. Click edit icon → edit form pre-filled with current data, preserves return page
5. Click delete icon → confirm dialog → soft delete → refetch table → success toast

**API Endpoints:**

| Method | Endpoint                                | Request Body                           | Response                              |
| ------ | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/backoffice-members?page=N&per_page=N` | —                                      | Paginated list with `meta.pagination` |
| POST   | `/backoffice-members`                   | `{ name, email, phone, password }`     | Created user object                   |
| GET    | `/backoffice-members/{id}`              | —                                      | User detail with role                 |
| PUT    | `/backoffice-members/{id}`              | `{ name?, email?, phone?, password? }` | Updated user object                   |
| DELETE | `/backoffice-members/{id}`              | —                                      | `null` (soft delete)                  |

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Table skeleton shows during initial load, progress bar during pagination
- Edit form pre-fills all fields from API detail response
- Password field is optional on edit — empty means keep current

### FM-07: Backoffice Notifications

**Route:** `/dashboard/notifications` (full page) + Navbar bell dropdown
**API Base:** `/api/v1/backoffice/notifications`
**Priority:** P1 — Core

| ID       | Feature                 | Status  | Description                                                                  |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FM-07-01 | Bell icon with badge    | ✅ Done | Navbar bell shows unread count, polls every 30s                              |
| FM-07-02 | Dropdown panel          | ✅ Done | Shows latest 5 notifications with type badges, timestamps, read/unread state |

| FM-07-05 | Full notifications page | ✅ Done | Paginated list using `useTableData`, sidebar entry                           |

**Architecture:**

- `useBackofficeNotificationStore` (Zustand) manages unread count, recent notifications, dropdown state
- `NotificationBell` component in Navbar handles dropdown UI + outside-click dismiss
- Full page at `/dashboard/notifications` uses `TableCard` + `TableCardPagination`
- Service layer at `services/backoffice/notifications/`

| --------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| `activity_log`        | Tertiary    | Sales creates/updates activity |
| `lead_assign_request` | Warning     | Sales requests lead assignment |
| `lead_status_request` | Success     | Sales requests status change   |

**API Endpoints:**

| Method | Endpoint                           | Request Body | Response                              |

| PATCH  | `/notifications/read-all`          | —            | `{ marked_count: number }`            |

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Bell badge shows numeric count (max "99+"), hidden when 0
- Dropdown closes on outside click (uses `mouseup` for React 19 compliance)

| -------- | ---------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| FM-08-01 | Timeline list page     | ✅ Done | Timeline/list view (not table) with ActivityCard items, chronological order                                                                                        |

| FM-08-03 | Search with URL sync   | ✅ Done | Debounced search via SearchInput, syncs `?search=` to URL, resets on change                                                                                        |
| FM-08-04 | Loading states         | ✅ Done | Skeleton placeholders (ActivityCardSkeleton) on initial load, spinner on more                                                                                      |
| FM-08-05 | Empty states           | ✅ Done | "Belum ada aktivitas" (no data) and "Tidak ada hasil" (no search results)                                                                                          |
| FM-08-06 | Error handling         | ✅ Done | Initial error with retry, load-more error with inline retry, data preservation                                                                                     |

| FM-08-08 | Attachment thumbnail   | ✅ Done | Image attachments show clickable thumbnail preview (max 120px, skeleton loading, error fallback); non-image attachments show file icon badge (PDF/DOC/XLS/generic) |

**Key Differences from Table Pages:**

- Uses **timeline/list view** instead of `TableCard` — data is chronological with visual type icons and relative timestamps
- Uses **`useInfiniteScroll` hook** instead of `useTableData` — append-based pagination with IntersectionObserver
- **ActivityCard** displays: type icon (FileText/UserPlus/RefreshCw), title, status badge (pending/approved/rejected), lead name, description, attachment preview (thumbnail or file icon badge), relative time

**Activity Types:**

| Type                         | Icon      | Color    | Description                   |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `general_note`               | FileText  | Tertiary | General activity note         |
| `request_lead_assign`        | UserPlus  | Primary  | Request to assign a lead      |
| `request_update_lead_status` | RefreshCw | Warning  | Request to update lead status |

**Status Badge Colors:**

| Status   | Badge Variant |
| -------- | ------------- |
| pending  | warning       |
| approved | success       |
| rejected | error         |

**API Endpoints:**

| Method | Endpoint                                 | Request Body                                                                                                                                                | Response                              |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/sales/activity-logs?page=N&per_page=N` | —                                                                                                                                                           | Paginated list with `meta.pagination` |
| POST   | `/sales/activity-logs`                   | `{ type, title, description?, lead_id?, attachment?, metadata?: { requested_status?, requested_sales_id? } }` — multipart/form-data when attachment present | Created activity log                  |

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Timeline displays activity logs in reverse chronological order
- Each ActivityCard shows type icon, title, status badge, lead name (if any), and relative time
- Infinite scroll loads next page when scroll sentinel enters viewport
- Search debounces input and syncs to URL `?search=` parameter
- Loading page with `?search=query` applies filter on mount
- Skeleton placeholders shown during initial load
- Existing data preserved when load-more fails
- Sidebar "Sales Activity Report" links to `/sales-activities`
- Create form validates title is not empty (whitespace-only rejected)
- "Requested Sales Member ID" field appears only when type is `request_lead_assign`, auto-populated from user profile (`sales_id`), and is read-only
- Successful submit shows success toast and redirects to sales activities list
- Validation errors (422) display per-field error messages; general errors show error toast
- Submit button disabled with loading indicator during submission
- File attachment sent as `multipart/form-data`; JSON otherwise
- `lead_id` is required when type is `request_lead_assign` or `request_update_lead_status`; label changes dynamically
- `request_update_lead_status`: lead dropdown only shows leads assigned to current sales user (`?assigned_to_me=1`); backend validates lead assignment + no pending request for same lead
- `request_lead_assign`: lead dropdown only shows unassigned leads (`?unassigned_only=1`); backend validates lead not already assigned to another sales
- Info banners explain constraints for each request type
- Lead selection clears when activity type changes (different types show different lead sets)
- Backend dispatches `NotifyBackofficeUsers` job on create, notifying all admin/backoffice users
- API response includes `attachment_url`, `thumbnail_url`, and `attachment_type` fields (appended via model accessors)
- Image attachments display a clickable thumbnail (max 120px width, rounded corners) that opens full-size in a new tab
- Non-image attachments display a file icon badge with extension label (PDF, DOC, XLS, or generic FILE)
- Thumbnail shows skeleton placeholder while loading; falls back to file icon on error

**Architecture:**

- `CommentThread` is a reusable component used in both backoffice detail and sales detail pages
- Comment access control is enforced at the service layer: only the activity log owner (sales) or reviewer (backoffice) can view/create comments
- Comments are only shown when the activity log status ≠ pending (i.e., after review)
- `NotifySalesUser` job targets a single sales user (unlike `NotifyBackofficeUsers` which broadcasts)
- Comment notifications target only the other party: sales comment → backoffice reviewer, reviewer comment → sales owner

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Table displays banners ordered by display_order asc, created_at desc
- Search filters by title (case-insensitive)
- Type and status filters work independently
- Image upload validates format (JPEG/PNG/WebP), size (max 2MB), and dimensions (1080x608 ±10px) client-side
- Target URL field available for both banner types (web URLs and deeplinks, max 500 chars)
- DOM-based canvas editor maintains 2:1 aspect ratio (matching mobile app's 280×140 banner card), text elements and CTA button are draggable within bounds
- Double-click text elements for inline editing
- Text element positions stored as percentage (0-100) for responsiveness
- CTA button configurable: text, colors (supports 8-char alpha hex like #FFFFFF33), border radius, font size, padding
- Template application applies background + text elements + CTA config together (4 templates matching mobile app's PromoBanner)
- Canvas capture on submit: text_placement banners are rendered to PNG (1080×540) via hidden canvas and uploaded as image file
- Preview modal simulates mobile viewport (~375px width) and renders CTA button
- New banners default to status "inactive" with next available display_order
- Soft delete — deleted banners excluded from list
- Mobile endpoint (`GET /client/banners`) returns only active banners ordered by display_order
- `api.ts` `post()` method auto-detects FormData and removes Content-Type header so axios sets multipart/form-data with boundary automatically

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Table displays service categories ordered by created_at descending
- Search filters by name via API search parameter (case-insensitive)
- Icon displayed as SVG thumbnail using Next.js `<Image>` with `unoptimized` prop
- Types displayed as individual badges per row
- Status toggle updates `is_active` inline without navigating to edit page
- Create form validates: name required, name max 255 chars, icon must be SVG, icon max 2MB
- Types field uses multi-checkbox (4 options visible at once), not multi-select dropdown
- Edit form pre-populates all fields including existing icon preview
- Edit form uses "Page + Inner Form" split pattern for React 19 compliance
- Icon upload is optional on both create and edit (nullable field)
- Slug is auto-generated by backend from name (not editable in frontend)
- Delete is guarded by ConfirmDialog before sending request
- Sidebar "Master Data" group with "Service Categories" item
- All pages use service layer pattern (no direct API calls from components)
